    <h3>History of Microsoft Paint</h3>
    <p>Microsoft Paint (formerly Paintbrush, not to be confused with the Mac OS X application, Paintbrush) is a simple
      raster graphics editor that has been included with all versions of Microsoft Windows. The program opens and saves
      files in Windows bitmap (BMP), JPEG, GIF, PNG, and single-page TIFF formats. The program can be in color mode or
      two-color black-and-white, but there is no grayscale mode. For its simplicity and that it is included with
      Windows,
      it rapidly became one of the most used applications in the early versions of Windows, introducing many to painting
      on a computer for the first time. It is still widely used for simple image manipulation tasks.<br><br>

      In July 2017, Microsoft added Paint to the list of deprecated Windows features and announced that it would become
      a
      free standalone application in the Microsoft Store, and also included a warning in the Paint application that it
      eventually won't be installed by default. <strong>Paint continued to be included with Windows 10 in later builds,
        and eventually an update removed the deprecation warning from the application.</strong></p>
